# BGP Path Plausibility

## Overview
Welcome to the BGP Path Plausibility project! This repository focuses on enhancing path plausibility algorithms to improve the security of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). The project aims to address existing limitations and propose innovative solutions to mitigate BGP prefix hijacking, route leaks, and forged-origin prefix hijacks.

## Objectives
- **Enhance Path Plausibility Algorithms:** Improve the efficiency and accuracy of ASPA and AS-Cones algorithms.
- **Develop Hybrid Algorithms:** Create hybrid algorithms combining the strengths of ASPA and AS-Cones.
- **Simulation and Analysis:** Test new algorithms in a detailed simulation environment and compare them with existing ones.
- **Deployment Strategies:** Develop optimized deployment strategies to maximize the benefits of the new algorithms.
- **Security Evaluation:** Assess the security improvements offered by the new algorithms against various attack vectors.

## File Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
